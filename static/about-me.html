        <h1>A little about me</h1>
        <p>
          Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Gab Savard and I'm a 21 years old Computer Science student. I am currently in
          the second year of my Bachelor's with CO-OP at Dalhousie University (Halifax, NS) which I am hoping to add an honour's thesis
          to.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I am an aspiring video game developer. I have been passionate about video games for as long as I can remember and have been
          coding them since I was 14. Lately, I have been participating in game jams (Global Game Jam being my favourite) and I have
          been studying game design and game development in my free time. Lately, I also have been trying to learn more about coding
          game physics.
          <br><br>
          Another field of study I enjoy is statistics, specifically, statistic models and A.I.. I am currently looking to start a
          research project in that field.
          <br><br>
          Outside of coding, I am also a musician. I have been producing my own music since 2019 and have been releasing it since then on
          platforms like Spotify, Apple music and YouTube. I am planning to release more music in the coming months and I can confidently
          say that music is my other passion.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>My hobbies</h3>
        <p>
          My hobbies include playing video games, playing music (who could've predicted?!), reading, hiking, traveling, cooking, and learning.
          My favourite video games / franchises are Assassin's Creed, Cyberpunk and City Skylines.
          <br><br>
          This year I decided to take on three challenges (or four depending on how you count):
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li>Switching my OS to Linux (Ubuntu)</li>
            <li>Learning C# and C++</li>
            <li>Uploading to my website regularly</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

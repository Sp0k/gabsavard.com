# gabsavard.com | My personal website

I am storing my personal website/portfolio in this repo. Feel free to use my work to help build your own website.

I will say tho, I still have not learned a framework to build a website with, so my entire website will be coded using
pure HTML, CSS and JS.

I would also like to add that the code stored in here might be slightly different from the one hosted on my web server.

## Special thanks
I want to thank a few people for helping me with the design and code of this website.

I would like to start with <a href="https://github.com/SuchithSridhar">Suchith Sridhar</a> with helping me
with the code, in particular the set up of the PHP page for the contact form, as well as the connection from
the server to my email inbox.

I would also like to thank my girlfriend, Amanda Nickerson, who put her art education to work and helped me
with the color schemes as well as designed and drew my home page hero-image. If you would like to see more
work from her, I would recommend checking her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mandimargdraws_/">Instagram account</a>.

Finally, I would also like to thank my dad who helped me set up the web server in the first place and helps me by
giving me his opinion on the designs before I code them and on changes he would do as well as testing the features for
bugs and other issues before they go live.
